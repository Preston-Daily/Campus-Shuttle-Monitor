# Development Enviroment Setup

Download Nodejs: https://nodejs.org/en/

Install expo using npm: https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/

Navigate to project directory: "Shuttle-Monitor"

Run command: "npm start"

On start, the project should launch with a QR code.
Use the expo mobile app that can be download on your mobile device's app store to scan the QR code.
From this point the project should compile and you should see a basic template app with 2 tabs.

(If you encounter an error while trying to launch the applicaion after scanning the QR code, change the connection type between Tunnel/LAN on the localhost webpage that launches on start and restart using npm start in your terminal.)
